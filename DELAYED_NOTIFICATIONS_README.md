# EGA Internal Tool - Automated Delayed Device Notifications

## üöÄ Automated Email System with Vercel Cron + Resend API

This system automatically sends professional HTML emails every Monday at 7:00 AM GST to selected employees when devices have overdue safety checks.

## üìß Email Features

- **Professional HTML Design**: Styled email with company branding
- **Device Details**: Lists device name, ID, location, check type, and days overdue
- **Smart Content**: Only sends emails when delayed devices exist
- **Tracking**: Uses Resend API tags for analytics
- **Responsive**: Works on all email clients and devices

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel deployment environment variables:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ksdrpfxuwavfwnccmrwr.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
EDGE_FN_NAME=make-server-354d5d14
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-cron-secret-key-change-this
```

### 2. Vercel Cron Configuration

The `vercel.json` file is already configured with:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/delayed-notifications",
      "schedule": "0 3 * * 1"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule Explanation:**
- `0 3 * * 1` = Monday at 3:00 AM UTC
- 3:00 AM UTC = 7:00 AM GST (Gulf Standard Time, GMT+4)

### 3. Resend API Setup

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new API key
3. Configure your domain (optional but recommended)
4. Update the "from" email in the code if needed

### 4. Deployment

Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Testing

**Manual Test (Development):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/test-delayed-notifications
```

**Manual Test (Production):**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/test-delayed-notifications
```

5. **Email Generation**: Creates professional HTML emails with device details
6. **Resend API**: Sends emails using Resend service
7. **Logging**: Records all email activities for tracking
